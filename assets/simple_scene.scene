description: Three spheres with Lambert materials for intersection testing

# Materials Section
# Format: material_name red green blue
material red_sphere 0.7 0.3 0.3
material blue_sphere 0.3 0.3 0.7
material green_sphere 0.3 0.7 0.3

# Spheres Section  
# Format: sphere center_x center_y center_z radius material_name
sphere 0.0 0.0 -5.0 1.0 red_sphere
sphere 2.0 0.0 -6.0 0.8 blue_sphere
sphere -1.5 1.0 -4.0 0.6 green_sphere

# Educational Notes:
# - Red sphere: Large central sphere for primary intersection testing
# - Blue sphere: Offset sphere to test closest-hit logic
# - Green sphere: Smaller sphere at different depth for depth testing
# - All spheres positioned in front of camera (negative Z) for visibility
# - Different radii to test intersection algorithm with varied sphere sizes
