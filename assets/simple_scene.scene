# Lighting Section
# Basic point light for educational visibility and material demonstration
# Format: light_point pos_x pos_y pos_z color_r color_g color_b intensity
light_point 2.0 2.0 -2.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 3.0

# Educational Notes:
# - Red sphere: Large central sphere for primary intersection testing
# - Blue sphere: Offset sphere to test closest-hit logic
# - Green sphere: Smaller sphere at different depth for depth testing
# - All spheres positioned in front of camera (negative Z) for visibility
# - Different radii to test intersection algorithm with varied sphere sizes
#
# Lighting Design:
# - Single point light positioned above and to the right (2, 2, -2)
# - White light (1.0, 1.0, 1.0) ensures neutral color representation
# - Intensity 3.0 provides clear visibility without overexposure
# - Light placement creates subtle shadows for depth perception
