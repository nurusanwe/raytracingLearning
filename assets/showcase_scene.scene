# Educational Notes:
# Scene Design Philosophy:
# - 11 spheres total for complex intersection testing
# - Varied radii (0.4 to 1.0) to test algorithm robustness
# - Strategic Z-depth distribution (-4.0 to -8.0) for depth complexity
# - Asymmetric positioning to avoid mathematical edge cases
# - Color variety demonstrates material system capabilities
# - Sphere count optimized for <1 minute render at 1024x768

# Performance Characteristics:
# - Intersection tests per ray: ~11 (one per sphere)
# - Expected hit rate: ~15-25% (realistic for scene density)
# - Memory usage: Scene data ~2KB + image buffer based on resolution
# - Ray count at 1024x768: 786,432 total rays
# - Estimated render time: 30-45 seconds on modern hardware

# Visual Composition:
# - Front row provides immediate visual interest
# - Middle row adds depth and complexity
# - Back row creates atmospheric perspective
# - Color progression from warm (front) to cool (back) adds depth
# - Size variation creates natural focal hierarchy
