# ================================================
# LIGHTING SYSTEM: MULTI-LIGHT DEMONSTRATION
# ================================================
# Three-point lighting setup for professional scene illumination
# Demonstrates multiple light types working together

# Key Light: Primary illumination from front-right
# Provides main illumination and defines primary shadows
light_point 3.0 2.0 -1.0 1.0 0.95 0.8 4.0

# Fill Light: Softer illumination from left to reduce harsh shadows
# Balances the key light and provides secondary illumination
light_point -2.0 1.0 -3.0 0.8 0.9 1.0 2.0

# Rim Light: Directional light from behind for edge definition
# Creates edge highlights and separates objects from background
light_directional 0.3 -0.5 1.0 0.9 0.8 1.0 1.5

# Educational Notes:
# Scene Design Philosophy:
# - 11 spheres total for complex intersection testing
# - Varied radii (0.4 to 1.0) to test algorithm robustness
# - Strategic Z-depth distribution (-4.0 to -8.0) for depth complexity
# - Asymmetric positioning to avoid mathematical edge cases
# - Color variety demonstrates material system capabilities
# - Sphere count optimized for <1 minute render at 1024x768

# Performance Characteristics:
# - Intersection tests per ray: ~11 (one per sphere)
# - Expected hit rate: ~15-25% (realistic for scene density)
# - Memory usage: Scene data ~2KB + image buffer based on resolution
# - Ray count at 1024x768: 786,432 total rays
# - Estimated render time: 30-45 seconds on modern hardware

# Visual Composition:
# - Front row provides immediate visual interest
# - Middle row adds depth and complexity
# - Back row creates atmospheric perspective
# - Color progression from warm (front) to cool (back) adds depth
# - Size variation creates natural focal hierarchy
#
# Multi-Light Design Philosophy:
# - Key light: Warm white (1.0, 0.95, 0.8) for primary subject illumination
# - Fill light: Cool white (0.8, 0.9, 1.0) for shadow balance and color variety
# - Rim light: Neutral warm (0.9, 0.8, 1.0) for edge definition and depth
# - Three-point lighting creates professional photographic quality
# - Different light types demonstrate various illumination models
# - Light intensity balanced to prevent overexposure while maintaining visibility
