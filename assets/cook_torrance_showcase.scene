# EDUCATIONAL NOTES AND LEARNING OBJECTIVES
# ================================================
# This scene demonstrates the following Cook-Torrance microfacet theory concepts:
#
# 1. ROUGHNESS EFFECTS:
#    - Low roughness (0.02): Sharp, mirror-like reflections (concentrated highlights)
#    - Medium roughness (0.3-0.5): Semi-glossy surfaces (moderate highlight spread)  
#    - High roughness (0.8-0.9): Diffuse-like behavior (broad highlight spread)
#
# 2. METALLIC vs DIELECTRIC BEHAVIOR:
#    - Metallic=1.0 (conductors): High reflectance, colored F0 from base_color
#    - Metallic=0.0 (dielectrics): Low F0 reflectance, transmissive behavior
#    - F0 determines reflection strength at normal viewing angles
#
# 3. FRESNEL EFFECT DEMONSTRATION:
#    - All materials show increased reflection at grazing angles
#    - Metals maintain colored reflection across angles
#    - Dielectrics transition from transmissive to reflective
#
# 4. ENERGY CONSERVATION:
#    - All parameters clamped to physically valid ranges
#    - No light amplification (energy conservation maintained)
#    - Realistic material behavior across parameter space
#
# 5. COMPARISON WITH LAMBERT MODEL:
#    - Lambert: Constant BRDF, viewing angle independent
#    - Cook-Torrance: Variable BRDF with viewing angle dependency
#    - Educational contrast between empirical and physically-based models
#
# RECOMMENDED LEARNING EXERCISES:
# - Render scene with different viewing angles to observe Fresnel effects
# - Compare specular highlights between different roughness values
# - Observe how metallic materials differ from dielectric materials
# - Validate energy conservation by checking that no materials amplify light
# - Test parameter boundaries (roughness limits, metallic interpolation)
#
# TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
# - All materials use physically plausible parameter ranges
# - Roughness limited to [0.01, 1.0] to prevent numerical instability
# - F0 values appropriate for material types (0.04 typical for dielectrics)
# - Scene layout optimized for educational comparison and visual learning
#
# LIGHTING DESIGN FOR MATERIAL EDUCATION:
# - Directional light: Creates consistent specular angles across all spheres
# - Point light: Provides focused highlights that vary by surface properties
# - Area light: Adds subtle ambient without masking material differences
# - Light positioning emphasizes roughness gradients (smooth → rough)
# - Color temperatures chosen to enhance metallic vs dielectric distinctions
# - Intensities balanced to prevent overexposure while maintaining highlight visibility
# - Multiple light types demonstrate how different illumination affects BRDF evaluation
