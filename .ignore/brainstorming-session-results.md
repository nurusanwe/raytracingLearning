## Technique Sessions

### First Principles Thinking - 15 minutes

**Description:** Breaking down pathtracer to fundamental components

**Ideas Generated:**
1. Core user experience: USD file loading, camera controls, environment lighting
2. Pathtracing physics: ray-surface interaction, BRDF energy calculation, recursive bouncing
3. Termination strategies: energy threshold, bounce limit, interaction efficiency
4. Single pixel calculation process: camera origin, surface hits, material interactions

**Insights Discovered:**
- User has solid theoretical understanding of BRDF physics
- Gap exists between theory and implementation
- Prefers real industry math over oversimplified examples
- Bounce limit termination is best starting point

**Notable Connections:**
- OpenPBR knowledge directly applicable to implementation
- MaterialX integration aligns with Adobe/industry standards
- 1-hour daily constraint requires focused, incremental approach

### Mind Mapping - 10 minutes

**Description:** Organizing pathtracer system architecture

**Ideas Generated:**
1. Ray Generation & Tracing as core priority
2. Material System (MaterialX/OpenPBR) as secondary priority
3. Supporting systems: USD loading, camera, lighting, display
4. Ray structure: origin, direction, energy tracking
5. Camera-to-screen coordinate transformation

**Insights Discovered:**
- Core algorithm should be implemented before supporting features
- Ray generation math needs simplification for learning
- Command-line interface preferred for initial iterations

### "Yes, and..." Building - 10 minutes

**Description:** Iterative expansion from simple ray implementation

**Ideas Generated:**
1. Basic ray structure: origin + direction
2. Multi-pixel ray generation loops
3. Simple red sphere BRDF example
4. Single OpenPBR lobe implementation (diffuse)

**Insights Discovered:**
- User wants real BRDF math, not oversimplified examples
- Hybrid approach preferred: hand-coded math → MaterialX integration
- Lambert's law diffuse lobe is good starting point
