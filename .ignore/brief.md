# Project Brief: 3D Pathtracer Learning Project

## Executive Summary

**Product Concept:** A modular C++ rendering engine that begins as a pathtracer for learning graphics fundamentals, designed to scale into a fully-featured renderer with eventual rasterization capabilities, featuring industry-standard MaterialX integration and OpenPBR material support.

**Primary Problem:** The gap between theoretical understanding of rendering concepts and practical implementation skills, particularly for developers who want to learn using real industry mathematics and build scalable, production-quality codebases rather than toy examples.

**Target Market:** Graphics engineers, technical product managers, and rendering enthusiasts seeking deep computer graphics knowledge through hands-on codebase exploration and incremental feature development.

**Key Value Proposition:** Learn-by-building approach using a modular architecture that supports both pathtracing and future rasterization, with Apple Silicon optimization and extensible design for multi-platform deployment, structured around digestible daily development sessions.

## Problem Statement

**Current State:** I have solid theoretical understanding of BRDF physics and pathtracing algorithms, but want to bridge that knowledge into production-quality C++ implementation skills. Most learning projects force a choice between quick prototypes that can't scale or diving into complex existing codebases that obscure the learning process.

**Personal Learning Challenge:**
- **Architecture Knowledge Gap:** Understanding how to design rendering systems that can grow from basic pathtracing to full-featured engines with multiple rendering backends
- **Industry Standards Learning:** Want to work with real production tools (MaterialX, OpenPBR, USD) rather than simplified academic examples, but need a structured approach to master them incrementally
- **Sustainable Learning Approach:** Need to balance comprehensive understanding with 1-hour daily learning sessions that provide consistent progress
- **Platform Optimization Skills:** Want to learn Apple Silicon-specific optimizations while maintaining code that can extend to other architectures

**Why This Matters to Me:**
- Build a personal learning laboratory where I can experiment with graphics concepts through hands-on implementation
- Create a codebase that grows with my understanding, from basic concepts to advanced rendering techniques
- Learn production-quality software architecture patterns specific to rendering engines
- Develop expertise with industry-standard tools and workflows through practical application

**Why Existing Approaches Don't Fit:**
- Tutorial implementations are too simple to teach real architecture patterns
- Open-source renderers are too complex to serve as learning vehicles
- Academic projects typically don't emphasize production-quality code structure
- Most learning resources don't demonstrate the path from pathtracer to hybrid renderer

**Learning Investment Rationale:** Building this system will provide deep understanding of rendering engine architecture while creating a personal toolkit for future graphics projects.

## Proposed Solution

**Core Approach:** Build a modular C++ rendering engine that starts with pathtracing fundamentals and architecturally supports future expansion to rasterization. Design the system with production-quality patterns from day one, allowing incremental learning of both rendering algorithms and software architecture.

**Key Solution Components:**

**Modular Architecture Design:**
- **Rendering Backend Abstraction:** Clean separation between rendering algorithms (pathtracer) and engine infrastructure, enabling future rasterizer integration
- **Platform Optimization Layer:** Apple Silicon-optimized foundation with extensible design for other architectures
- **Industry Standard Integration:** Native support for USD scene loading and MaterialX/OpenPBR material definitions

**Learning-Driven Implementation Strategy:**
- **Phase 1: Core Pathtracing Loop** - Implement fundamental ray generation, intersection testing, and simple BRDF evaluation with solid architectural foundations
- **Phase 2: Industry Integration** - Add MaterialX support and USD loading while maintaining the core architecture
- **Phase 3: Advanced Features** - Multi-lobe BRDFs, complex lighting, and performance optimizations
- **Future: Rasterization Backend** - Leverage the modular architecture to add real-time rendering capabilities

**Incremental Complexity Management:**
- Start with hand-coded Lambert BRDF using real OpenPBR mathematics, not oversimplified academic examples
- Build single-pixel calculation first, then extend to full image rendering
- Implement bounce-limit termination before exploring more sophisticated strategies
- Each feature addition maintains architectural integrity and learning value

**Why This Solution Succeeds:**
- **Architecture-First Approach:** Learn production patterns while implementing features, not as an afterthought
- **Real Industry Math:** Use actual OpenPBR formulations and MaterialX workflows from the beginning
- **Sustainable Learning Pace:** 1-hour daily sessions focused on single, well-defined components
- **Personal Laboratory:** Provides unlimited experimentation space for testing graphics concepts
- **Future-Proof Foundation:** Modular design supports adding rasterization, GPU acceleration, or other rendering techniques
