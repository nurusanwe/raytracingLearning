**Secondary Navigation:** Context-sensitive parameter panels that reveal mathematical details on demand

**Breadcrumb Strategy:** Concept-based progression showing learning path: Basic Rendering → Material Physics → Advanced Techniques

**Key Insight:** Students need visual engagement first, then mathematical understanding. The interface should inspire continued learning rather than present barriers to entry.

## User Flows

### Flow 1: First Ray Tracing Experience

**User Goal:** Understand basic ray-sphere intersection through immediate visual feedback

**Entry Points:** Application launch, "Getting Started" tutorial

**Success Criteria:** Student sees rendered sphere and understands the mathematical relationship between ray calculations and visual output

#### Flow Diagram

| Error | #E53E3E | Calculation errors, invalid inputs |
| Neutral | #E2E8F0, #A0AEC0, #718096 | Text hierarchy, subtle borders, disabled states |

### Typography

#### Font Families
- **Primary:** System font stack (SF Pro, Segoe UI, Roboto) for UI elements
- **Secondary:** Same as primary for consistency
- **Monospace:** SF Mono, Consolas, Monaco for code and mathematical output

#### Type Scale

| H2 | 20px | 600 | 1.3 |
| H3 | 16px | 600 | 1.4 |
| Body | 14px | 400 | 1.5 |
| Small | 12px | 400 | 1.4 |

### Iconography

**Icon Library:** Lucide or Heroicons for consistent, minimal developer-focused icons

**Usage Guidelines:** Use icons sparingly, prioritize text labels for educational clarity, maintain consistent sizing (16px/20px)

### Spacing & Layout

**Grid System:** 8px base unit for consistent spacing and alignment

**Spacing Scale:** 4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px progression for margins and padding

## Accessibility Requirements

### Compliance Target

**Standard:** Basic accessibility principles rather than formal WCAG compliance - focus on readable text, keyboard navigation, and clear visual hierarchy for educational effectiveness.

### Key Requirements

**Visual:**
- Color contrast ratios: Minimum 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text (supports readability of mathematical formulas)
- Focus indicators: Clear visual focus states for all interactive elements
- Text sizing: Scalable text that remains readable at 150% zoom (important for detailed mathematical output)

**Interaction:**
- Keyboard navigation: Tab-based navigation through parameter controls and interface elements
- Screen reader support: Semantic HTML structure with proper headings and labels (helps with code organization)
- Touch targets: Minimum 44px for clickable elements (future touch interface consideration)

**Content:**
- Alternative text: Descriptive alt text for ray visualization graphics and mathematical diagrams
- Heading structure: Logical H1-H6 hierarchy for mathematical concepts and interface sections
- Form labels: Clear labels for all parameter input fields with units and ranges

### Testing Strategy

**Basic Testing Approach:** Keyboard-only navigation testing and high-contrast mode validation to ensure interface remains functional and readable under different conditions.

## Responsiveness Strategy

**Design Priority:** Desktop-first for development environments. Support laptop and external monitor configurations.

### Breakpoints

| Breakpoint | Min Width | Target Use Case |
|------------|-----------|-----------------|
| Laptop | 1280px | MacBook development |
| Desktop | 1920px+ | External monitors, ultrawide displays |

### Adaptation Patterns

**Layout Changes:** Flexible layout that scales from laptop to wide monitors. Single unified interface.

**Content Priority:** Mathematical output and visual viewport scale proportionally. All features remain accessible.

## Animation & Micro-interactions

**Design Philosophy:** Prioritize mathematical accuracy and immediate feedback over polished animations. Focus development effort on core rendering features rather than interface polish.

### Motion Principles

**Mathematical Precision First:** Favor instant, accurate updates over smooth transitions. Students need immediate cause-and-effect feedback to understand parameter relationships.

**Minimal Animation Overhead:** Avoid animations that compete with rendering performance or distract from mathematical learning objectives.

### Key Interactions

- **Immediate Parameter Feedback:** Instant visual updates when material parameters change (no transition delays)
- **Mathematical Value Updates:** Direct numerical updates without counter animations
- **Basic Focus Indicators:** Simple highlight states for interactive elements (no elaborate transitions)
- **Essential Loading States:** Simple progress indicators for rendering operations only when necessary

**Key Insight:** Professional rendering tools prioritize immediate, accurate feedback over polished animations. Educational value comes from mathematical transparency, not interface sophistication.

## Performance Considerations

### Performance Goals

- **Page Load:** Interface should load instantly, rendering engine initialization is separate concern
- **Interaction Response:** Parameter changes should update interface in <16ms to maintain 60fps responsiveness
- **Animation FPS:** No complex animations - simple state changes only

### Design Strategies

**Lightweight Interface:** Minimize DOM complexity and avoid heavy JavaScript frameworks that would compete with rendering calculations for CPU resources.

**Separation of Concerns:** Interface performance must not impact rendering performance. UI updates should never block ray tracing calculations.

**Developer-Focused Optimization:** Optimize for development workflow efficiency rather than end-user polish. Fast iteration cycles are more important than smooth animations.

**Resource Prioritization:** Rendering engine gets priority access to CPU and GPU resources. Interface uses remaining capacity only.

**Measurement Strategy:** Monitor interface overhead to ensure it doesn't interfere with ray tracing performance learning objectives. Profile rendering vs. interface resource usage separately.

**Key Principle:** The interface should be invisible to performance - students should be learning rendering optimization, not fighting interface bottlenecks.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. **Begin Epic 1 console implementation** using the mathematical display and console output components defined in this specification
2. **Set up basic project structure** following the lightweight interface architecture outlined
3. **Validate design decisions** against actual ray tracing implementation needs as development progresses
4. **Create simple HTML mockup** of the unified learning interface for GUI development phases
