# 3D Pathtracer Learning Project Architecture Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the complete system architecture for **3D Pathtracer Learning Project**, a native C++ educational rendering engine that bridges mathematical transparency with production-quality patterns. Unlike traditional fullstack web applications, this "fullstack" encompasses the complete rendering pipeline: backend ray tracing engine + frontend interactive interface + industry-standard content pipeline integration.

**Critical Architectural Principle:** **Education-First with Production Patterns** - Every architectural decision must demonstrably serve learning objectives while establishing transferable industry patterns. When conflicts arise, educational transparency takes precedence in early epics, with production quality becoming dominant in later phases.

### Architectural Decision Framework

To address the inherent tension between educational and production requirements, this architecture establishes clear decision criteria:

**Epic 1-2 (Foundation):** Prioritize mathematical transparency and build system simplicity. Accept some performance overhead for educational clarity.

**Epic 3-4 (Industry Standards):** Balance educational visibility with industry pattern adoption. Introduce abstractions gradually with clear before/after comparisons.

**Epic 5-6 (Production Quality):** Prioritize production patterns while maintaining educational documentation of optimization decisions.

### Platform Strategy

**Primary Platform:** macOS Apple Silicon for optimization learning
**Cross-Platform Foundation:** Abstract SIMD operations and rendering backends from Epic 1 using preprocessor directives and function pointers, not complex abstraction hierarchies.

**Risk Mitigation:** Build minimal cross-platform compatibility early (console interface works everywhere) rather than waiting until Epic 6 for platform abstraction.

### Starter Template Decision

**Status:** Greenfield C++ project with **educational-specific build system**

**Key Insight:** Rather than following traditional CMake patterns, the build system will prioritize:
1. **Single Command Setup:** `./build.sh` works on any system with minimal dependencies
2. **Educational Visibility:** Build process shows exactly what's happening (no hidden CMake complexity)  
3. **Incremental Complexity:** Build requirements grow with epic progression, not front-loaded

**Risk Mitigation:** Prototype build system and Dear ImGui integration in Epic 1 to validate architectural assumptions before committing to later epic dependencies.

## High Level Architecture

### Technical Summary

The **3D Pathtracer Learning Project** implements a **modular native C++ architecture** with progressive complexity management, deployed as a **single educational executable** with console-to-GUI interface evolution. The **Apple Silicon-optimized rendering backend** integrates with a **lightweight educational frontend** (Dear ImGui) through a **plugin-based renderer abstraction**. Key integration points include **real-time parameter binding** between UI controls and BRDF calculations, **educational debugging visualization** overlays, and **industry-standard content pipeline** (MaterialX/USD) integration. The architecture supports **seamless platform abstraction** while optimizing for Apple Silicon NEON vectorization and Metal Performance Shaders, achieving PRD goals through **incremental feature progression** from single-ray console output to production-quality hybrid rendering with comprehensive mathematical transparency.

### Platform and Infrastructure Choice

**Platform:** Apple Silicon (macOS) with cross-platform abstraction layer  
**Key Services:** Native C++ executable, Dear ImGui UI framework, Metal Performance Shaders, NEON vectorization  
**Deployment Host and Regions:** Local development environment (single-user educational tool)

### Repository Structure

**Structure:** Educational Monorepo with Epic Progression  
**Monorepo Tool:** Custom CMake configuration (not Nx/Turborepo - those are for web projects)  
**Package Organization:** Epic-based modules with clear educational progression and shared mathematical foundations

### Architectural Patterns

- **Educational Progression Pattern:** Incremental complexity management from single-file to modular architecture - _Rationale:_ Allows students to understand each abstraction layer as it's introduced rather than overwhelming with full architecture complexity

- **Plugin-Based Renderer Architecture:** Abstract renderer interface supporting console, software, and future GPU backends - _Rationale:_ Enables experimentation with different rendering approaches while maintaining educational interface consistency

- **Mathematical Transparency Pattern:** Every calculation exposed through debugging interfaces with step-by-step breakdown - _Rationale:_ Core educational requirement for understanding ray tracing mathematics in practice

- **Platform Abstraction with Optimization Hooks:** Cross-platform base implementation with platform-specific optimization injection points - _Rationale:_ Balances educational accessibility with Apple Silicon optimization learning objectives

- **Industry Standards Integration Pattern:** Gradual introduction of MaterialX/USD through educational wrappers before full industry API exposure - _Rationale:_ Prevents external library complexity from overwhelming core graphics learning

- **Performance Monitoring as Educational Tool:** Built-in profiling and statistics generation for educational insight rather than production optimization - _Rationale:_ Students learn optimization thinking through measurement and analysis, not just theoretical knowledge

## Tech Stack

This is the **DEFINITIVE technology selection** for the entire project. All development must use these exact versions and approaches. The stack is optimized for Apple Silicon while maintaining cross-platform extensibility through abstraction layers.

## Progressive Dependency Management Strategy

The project follows a **progressive dependency introduction** approach, aligning with the epic-based learning progression to prevent overwhelming students with complex external libraries while building towards industry-standard tools.

### Epic-Based Dependency Introduction

**Epic 1 (Foundation): Zero External Dependencies**
- **Philosophy**: Pure C++ implementation for mathematical transparency
- **Dependencies**: None - completely self-contained educational code
- **Build Requirements**: C++20 compiler, CMake 3.25+
- **Rationale**: Students focus on ray tracing mathematics without library complexity

**Epic 2 (Visual Foundation): Minimal UI Dependencies**
- **New Dependencies**: 
  - Dear ImGui 1.90+ (git submodule)
  - GLFW (system package: `brew install glfw` / `apt install libglfw3-dev`)
  - OpenGL (system-provided)
  - STB libraries (single-header: stb_image.h, stb_image_write.h)
- **Integration Strategy**: Git submodules for Dear ImGui, direct download for STB headers
- **Rationale**: Lightweight UI for real-time parameter manipulation without complex frameworks

**Epic 3-4 (Advanced Materials): Mathematical Validation Dependencies**
- **New Dependencies**:
  - GLM 0.9.9+ (optional for mathematical validation)
- **Integration Strategy**: Header-only library via package manager or git submodule
- **Rationale**: Industry reference for validating student's mathematical implementations

**Epic 5-6 (Optional Advanced): Industry Integration Dependencies**
- **New Dependencies** (Optional Advanced Modules):
  - MaterialX 1.38+ (Academy Software Foundation standard)
  - USD Core 23.05+ (Pixar Universal Scene Description)
  - OpenEXR 3.1+ (High dynamic range imaging)
- **Integration Strategy**: vcpkg or manual building for complex libraries
- **Rationale**: Industry exposure without overwhelming core educational objectives

## Data Models

The core data models represent the mathematical and scene entities shared between the rendering engine and educational interface, **enhanced with educational debugging infrastructure and real-time parameter binding** to support the interactive learning experience.

### Vector3 (Enhanced with Educational Features)

**Purpose:** Fundamental 3D mathematical operations with **calculation history tracking** and **educational validation**

**Key Attributes:**
- x, y, z: float - Components optimized for SIMD operations
- Clean, minimal interface suitable for Apple Silicon NEON vectorization

#### TypeScript Interface
```cpp
class Vector3 {
public:
    float x, y, z;
    
    // Core mathematical operations - optimized and clean
    Vector3(float x = 0.0f, float y = 0.0f, float z = 0.0f) : x(x), y(y), z(z) {}
    
    float dot(const Vector3& other) const;
    Vector3 cross(const Vector3& other) const;  
    Vector3 normalized() const;
    float length() const;
    float length_squared() const;
    
    // Standard arithmetic operators
    Vector3 operator+(const Vector3& other) const;
    Vector3 operator-(const Vector3& other) const;  
    Vector3 operator*(float scalar) const;
    
    // Production validation (minimal overhead)
    bool is_finite() const;
    bool is_normalized(float tolerance = 0.001f) const;
};
```

#### Educational Inspection Layer (Separate)
```cpp
class Vector3Inspector {
public:
    static std::string explain_dot_product(const Vector3& a, const Vector3& b, float result);
    static std::string explain_cross_product(const Vector3& a, const Vector3& b, const Vector3& result);
    static std::string explain_normalization(const Vector3& input, const Vector3& result);
    
    // Optional calculation tracking (enabled only when needed)
    static void enable_calculation_tracking(bool enable);
    static std::vector<std::string> get_recent_calculations();
    static void clear_calculation_history();
    
private:
    static thread_local std::vector<std::string> calculation_log;
    static std::atomic<bool> tracking_enabled;
};
```

### Material (Clean Core with Parameter Binding Adapter)

**Purpose:** Surface material properties for BRDF evaluation

#### TypeScript Interface  
```cpp
enum class MaterialType {
    Lambert,
    CookTorrance, 
    OpenPBR
};

class Material {
public:
    Vector3 base_color;
    float roughness;
    float metallic;
    float specular;
    Vector3 emission;
    MaterialType type;
    
    Material(const Vector3& color = Vector3(0.7f, 0.7f, 0.7f),
             float roughness = 0.5f,
             MaterialType type = MaterialType::Lambert);
    
    // Core BRDF evaluation - clean and fast
    Vector3 evaluate_brdf(const Vector3& wi, const Vector3& wo, const Vector3& normal) const;
    
    // Production validation
    bool validate_parameters() const;
    void clamp_to_valid_ranges();
};
```

### Scene (Clean Core with Educational Monitoring)

**Purpose:** Scene container optimized for rendering performance

#### TypeScript Interface
```cpp
class Scene {
public:
    std::vector<Primitive> primitives;
    std::vector<Material> materials;
    std::vector<Light> lights;
    Camera camera;
    Vector3 background;
    
    Scene() = default;
    
    struct Intersection {
        bool hit;
        float t;
        Vector3 point;
        Vector3 normal;  
        const Material* material;
        const Primitive* primitive;
    };
    
    Intersection intersect(const Ray& ray) const;
    
    // Standard scene management
    int add_material(const Material& material);
    int add_primitive(const Primitive& primitive);
    void set_camera(const Camera& camera);
};
```

## Refined API Specification - Educational Clarity Focus

**Core Principle:** Simple, clear progression from Epic 1 functions to Epic 6 optimized classes with consistent educational debugging and single-source-of-truth control.

### Unified Educational Control System

#### Single Educational Mode Controller
```cpp
namespace EducationalMode {
    enum Level {
        Production,    // No educational overhead - Epic 6 target
        Learning,      // Essential explanations - Epic 2-4 balance  
        Debugging      // Full mathematical transparency - Epic 1 start
    };
    
    void set_level(Level level);
    Level get_level();
    
    // All educational features controlled through this single system
    bool is_explanation_enabled();      // Controls all explanation methods
    bool is_console_output_enabled();   // Controls all printf/console output
    bool is_validation_enabled();       // Controls all mathematical validation
    
    // Simple memory management for educational features
    void set_max_memory_mb(int max_mb); // Limits educational data storage
    void cleanup_educational_data();    // Clears old calculation logs
}
```

### Epic 1: Foundation API - Maximum Simplicity

**Purpose:** Single-file functions with complete mathematical transparency

#### Core Educational Functions
```cpp
namespace Epic1 {
    
    // Students start with this single function call
    Vector3 trace_single_ray() {
        // Hard-coded educational example with full mathematical breakdown
        // Students see every calculation step in the actual implementation
        
        if (EducationalMode::is_console_output_enabled()) {
            printf("=== Epic 1: Single Ray Tracing Calculation ===\n");
        }
        
        // All mathematics visible in the implementation, not separate explanation functions
        Ray camera_ray(Vector3(0, 0, 0), Vector3(0, 0, -1));
        Vector3 sphere_center(0, 0, -5);
        float sphere_radius = 1.0f;
        
        // Ray-sphere intersection with educational comments IN the code
        Vector3 oc = camera_ray.origin - sphere_center;
        float b = oc.dot(camera_ray.direction);
        float c = oc.dot(oc) - sphere_radius * sphere_radius;
        float discriminant = b * b - c;
        
        if (EducationalMode::is_console_output_enabled()) {
            printf("Ray-sphere intersection: b=%g, c=%g, discriminant=%g\n", b, c, discriminant);
        }
        
        if (discriminant < 0) return Vector3(0.2f, 0.2f, 0.8f);
        
        float t = -b - sqrt(discriminant);
        Vector3 hit_point = camera_ray.point_at(t);
        Vector3 normal = (hit_point - sphere_center).normalized();
        
        // Lambert BRDF calculation
        Vector3 light_pos(2, 2, 0);
        Vector3 light_dir = (light_pos - hit_point).normalized();
        float cos_theta = std::max(0.0f, normal.dot(light_dir));
        
        Vector3 material_color(0.7f, 0.3f, 0.3f);
        Vector3 final_color = material_color * cos_theta;
        
        if (EducationalMode::is_console_output_enabled()) {
            printf("Lambert shading: cos(θ)=%g, final_color=(%g,%g,%g)\n", 
                   cos_theta, final_color.x, final_color.y, final_color.z);
        }
        
        return final_color;
    }
}
```

## Deployment Architecture

Based on the simplified single-codebase educational architecture, deployment focuses on **local development environments** rather than traditional web application deployment patterns.

### Deployment Strategy

**Educational Application Deployment:**
- **Platform:** Native C++ executable for local development and learning
- **Build Command:** `./tools/build_simple.sh` (single command for all platforms)
- **Output Directory:** `build/` directory with `raytracer` executable
- **Distribution Method:** Git repository cloning with educational progression through branches

**Development Environment Requirements:**
- **Primary Platform:** macOS with Apple Silicon for optimization learning (Epic 6)
- **Secondary Platform:** macOS Intel and Linux for cross-platform compatibility validation
- **Minimum Requirements:** C++20 compiler, basic OpenGL support, git
- **Educational Dependencies:** Dear ImGui (bundled), STB libraries (single-header)

## Testing Strategy

The testing approach focuses on **mathematical correctness validation** and **educational learning verification** rather than traditional software testing patterns.

### Educational Testing Pyramid

```
              Learning Validation Tests
                 /              \
         Mathematical Tests    Visual Tests
        /                    \              \
   Unit Tests         Integration Tests   Performance Tests
```

### Core Testing Framework

#### Mathematical Correctness Testing
```cpp
// tests/test_math_correctness.cpp - Primary educational validation
#include "src/core/vector3.hpp"
#include "src/core/material.hpp"
#include "src/core/scene.hpp"

namespace MathematicalTests {
    
    // Epic 1: Foundation mathematics validation
    bool test_vector3_operations() {
        Vector3 a(1, 2, 3);
        Vector3 b(4, 5, 6);
        
        // Validate dot product calculation
        float dot_result = a.dot(b);
        float expected_dot = 1*4 + 2*5 + 3*6; // 32
        assert(abs(dot_result - expected_dot) < 1e-6);
        
        // Validate normalization
        Vector3 normalized = a.normalized();
        assert(abs(normalized.length() - 1.0f) < 1e-6);
        
        return true;
    }
    
    bool test_ray_sphere_intersection() {
        // Validate quadratic equation solution for ray-sphere intersection
        Ray ray(Vector3(0, 0, 0), Vector3(0, 0, -1));
        Vector3 sphere_center(0, 0, -5);
        float sphere_radius = 1.0f;
        
        // Calculate intersection using student's implementation
        Scene scene;
        // Add sphere to scene...
        Scene::Intersection hit = scene.intersect(ray);
        
        // Validate mathematical correctness
        assert(hit.hit == true);
        assert(abs(hit.t - 4.0f) < 1e-6); // Expected t = 5 - 1 = 4
        
        return true;
    }
    
    // Epic 3: BRDF energy conservation validation
    bool test_cook_torrance_energy_conservation() {
        Material material(Vector3(0.7f, 0.3f, 0.3f), 0.5f, MaterialType::CookTorrance);
        
        // Integrate BRDF over hemisphere - should not exceed 1.0 (energy conservation)
        float total_energy = 0.0f;
        int samples = 10000;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < samples; i++) {
            // Generate random hemisphere directions
            Vector3 wi = generate_random_hemisphere_direction();
            Vector3 wo = Vector3(0, 0, 1); // Fixed outgoing direction
            Vector3 normal(0, 0, 1);
            
            Vector3 brdf_value = material.evaluate_brdf(wi, wo, normal);
            float cos_theta = normal.dot(wi);
            total_energy += brdf_value.length() * cos_theta * (2 * M_PI / samples);
        }
        
        // Energy conservation: total energy should not exceed 1.0
        assert(total_energy <= 1.01f); // Small tolerance for numerical precision
        
        return true;
    }
}
```

## Security and Performance

### Security Requirements

**Educational Environment Security:**
- **Code Safety for Learning:** C++ smart pointers and RAII patterns to prevent crashes during learning sessions
- **Input Validation:** Scene file and parameter validation to prevent educational disruption
- **Educational Data Privacy:** No collection of student code or learning data
- **Safe Compilation:** Build system protections against malicious code injection in educational content

### Performance Optimization

**Educational Performance Philosophy:** Performance optimization serves educational objectives rather than production requirements. Students learn optimization concepts through measurement and guided improvement of their own implementations.

**Performance Requirements:**
- **UI Responsiveness:** Dear ImGui interface maintains 60 FPS for real-time parameter manipulation
- **Educational Feedback:** Mathematical explanations and console output don't block rendering
- **Progressive Rendering:** Students see visual feedback within 1-2 seconds for small scenes
- **Memory Management:** Educational features limited to 512MB budget to prevent system impact

## Scene Data Format Specifications

// src/core/educational_mode.hpp - Enhanced with visual learning
namespace EducationalMode {
    enum Level { Production, Learning, Debugging, VisualDebugging };
    
    // Enhanced control system
    void set_level(Level level);
    bool show_calculations();           // Mathematical transparency (existing)
    bool enable_validation();          // Parameter validation (existing)

## Error Handling Strategy

The educational ray tracing system requires error handling that serves learning objectives rather than production robustness. Errors become educational opportunities for understanding mathematical relationships and physical constraints.

### Educational Error Handling Philosophy

**Errors as Learning Opportunities:** When students encounter errors, the system provides educational context and guidance rather than cryptic technical messages.

**Mathematical Validation with Explanation:** Parameter validation explains physical and mathematical constraints, helping students understand ray tracing theory through boundary conditions.

**Graceful Educational Recovery:** System recovers from errors while maintaining educational transparency about what went wrong and why.

## Monitoring and Observability

Educational monitoring focuses on learning insights and performance understanding rather than production system monitoring.

### Educational Performance Monitoring

#### Learning-Focused Performance Analysis
