# Security and Performance

## Security Requirements

**Educational Environment Security:**
- **Code Safety for Learning:** C++ smart pointers and RAII patterns to prevent crashes during learning sessions
- **Input Validation:** Scene file and parameter validation to prevent educational disruption
- **Educational Data Privacy:** No collection of student code or learning data
- **Safe Compilation:** Build system protections against malicious code injection in educational content

## Performance Optimization

**Educational Performance Philosophy:** Performance optimization serves educational objectives rather than production requirements. Students learn optimization concepts through measurement and guided improvement of their own implementations.

**Performance Requirements:**
- **UI Responsiveness:** Dear ImGui interface maintains 60 FPS for real-time parameter manipulation
- **Educational Feedback:** Mathematical explanations and console output don't block rendering
- **Progressive Rendering:** Students see visual feedback within 1-2 seconds for small scenes
- **Memory Management:** Educational features limited to 512MB budget to prevent system impact
