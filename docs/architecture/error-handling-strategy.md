# Error Handling Strategy

The educational ray tracing system requires error handling that serves learning objectives rather than production robustness. Errors become educational opportunities for understanding mathematical relationships and physical constraints.

## Educational Error Handling Philosophy

**Errors as Learning Opportunities:** When students encounter errors, the system provides educational context and guidance rather than cryptic technical messages.

**Mathematical Validation with Explanation:** Parameter validation explains physical and mathematical constraints, helping students understand ray tracing theory through boundary conditions.

**Graceful Educational Recovery:** System recovers from errors while maintaining educational transparency about what went wrong and why.
