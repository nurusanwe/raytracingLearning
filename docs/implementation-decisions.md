# Implementation Decisions Log

This document records key implementation decisions made during the development of the educational ray tracer, with emphasis on their educational value and mathematical rationale.

## Decision: Float vs Double Precision

- Error accumulation minimal for single-bounce ray tracing
- Educational benefit: demonstrates numerical precision concepts

**Educational Justification**: 
Using float precision helps students understand:
- IEEE 754 floating-point representation

## Decision: Epsilon Tolerance (1e-6)

**Rationale**: Balance between numerical stability and educational precision  
**Alternatives Considered**: 1e-5 (looser), 1e-8 (tighter), adaptive tolerance, machine epsilon  
**Learning Value**: Students learn about floating-point comparison challenges  
**Mathematical Basis**: Sufficient for typical ray tracing coordinate ranges and float precision  

**Numerical Analysis**:
- Float precision machine epsilon: ~1.19e-7
- 1e-6 provides safety margin above machine epsilon
- Prevents self-intersection artifacts in ray-surface calculations
- Appropriate scale for educational geometry (unit spheres, reasonable distances)

**Educational Justification**:
This tolerance teaches students:
- Why direct floating-point equality comparison fails
- Scale-dependent nature of numerical precision
- Importance of epsilon values in geometric algorithms
- Balance between robustness and mathematical correctness

## Decision: Lambert BRDF with ρ/π Normalization

**Rationale**: Physically correct energy conservation with clear mathematical foundation  
**Alternatives Considered**: Unnormalized Lambert, empirical approximations, simplified models  
**Learning Value**: Students understand physics-based rendering principles  
**Mathematical Foundation**: Derived from hemisphere integration for energy conservation  

**Physical Derivation**:
```
Energy conservation requirement: ∫_hemisphere f_r cos(θ) dω = ρ
For constant Lambert BRDF: f_r ∫_hemisphere cos(θ) dω = ρ
Since ∫_hemisphere cos(θ) dω = π, therefore f_r = ρ/π

## Decision: 1e-6 Epsilon for Ray Self-Intersection Prevention

**Rationale**: Prevent common ray tracing artifact with educational explanation  
**Alternatives Considered**: Surface offset, normal-based bias, adaptive epsilon

## Summary

These implementation decisions prioritize educational value over industrial optimization. The codebase serves as a teaching tool for understanding the mathematical foundations of computer graphics, ray tracing, and physically-based rendering. Each decision balances mathematical correctness, educational clarity, and practical implementation constraints.

The choices made here create a foundation for students to understand both the theoretical underpinnings and practical considerations in computer graphics programming. Future extensions should maintain this educational focus while introducing more advanced concepts incrementally.
