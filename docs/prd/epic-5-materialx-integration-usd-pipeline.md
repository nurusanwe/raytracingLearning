# Epic 5: MaterialX Integration & USD Pipeline

**Expanded Goal:** Integrate MaterialX node graph evaluation and USD scene loading with comprehensive material authoring workflow to deliver production pipeline compatibility. This epic transforms the standalone renderer into a production-ready tool capable of handling industry-standard content creation workflows while maintaining educational transparency.

## Story 5.1 MaterialX Node Graph Integration
As a **graphics programming learner**,
I want **MaterialX node graph evaluation supporting OpenPBR materials**,
so that **I can understand production material authoring workflows and node-based material creation**.

## Story 5.2 USD Scene Loading Pipeline
As a **graphics programming learner**,
I want **complete USD scene loading with geometry, materials, and lighting data**,
so that **I can render industry-standard scene files and understand production pipeline formats**.

## Story 5.3 Production Material Authoring Workflow  
As a **graphics programming learner**,
I want **comprehensive material authoring tools with MaterialX export capability**,
so that **I can create materials that integrate with professional content creation workflows**.
