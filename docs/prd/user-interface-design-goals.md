# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
Graphics programming education prioritizes mathematical transparency over polished user experience. The interface should expose rendering pipeline calculations and provide immediate visual feedback for parameter changes. Think "developer tools aesthetic" with comprehensive debugging visualization rather than consumer application polish.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Mathematical Transparency:** Every UI element should reveal the underlying calculations and allow inspection of intermediate values
- **Real-time Parameter Manipulation:** Sliders and controls that provide immediate visual feedback for BRDF parameters, lighting conditions, and camera settings
- **Educational Debugging:** Visual tools that illuminate ray behavior, energy calculations, and algorithmic decisions for learning reinforcement
- **Progressive Complexity:** Interface complexity grows with implemented features, starting with console output and expanding to graphical controls

## Core Screens and Views
- **Console Output Display:** Primary interface showing calculated color values and mathematical intermediate results
- **Parameter Control Panel:** Real-time adjustment of material properties, lighting parameters, and rendering settings
- **Ray Visualization Window:** Debug view showing ray paths, intersection points, and energy calculations
- **Performance Monitoring Dashboard:** Display of frame timing, ray count statistics, and optimization metrics
- **Scene Configuration Interface:** Controls for camera positioning, object placement, and lighting setup

## Accessibility: None
Educational development tool focused on graphics programming learning rather than general user accessibility

## Branding
Developer-focused aesthetic emphasizing function over form. Clean typography for mathematical formulas, high-contrast colors for debugging visualization, and professional developer tool appearance. Think Xcode/Visual Studio aesthetic rather than consumer graphics application.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Interface should work across development environments while optimizing for Apple Silicon development workflow
