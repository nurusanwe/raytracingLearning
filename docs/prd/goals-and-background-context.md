# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Build deep understanding of rendering engine architecture through hands-on implementation from pathtracing fundamentals to production-quality hybrid renderer
- Master integration of industry-standard tools (MaterialX, USD, OpenPBR) in practical graphics programming context
- Develop Apple Silicon optimization expertise while maintaining extensible cross-platform architecture foundation
- Create modular C++ rendering engine that serves as comprehensive learning laboratory for graphics programming concepts
- Establish production-quality code patterns and architectural thinking through incremental complexity management

## Background Context

This project addresses the critical gap between theoretical understanding of rendering concepts and practical implementation skills. Most graphics learning resources force a choice between oversimplified tutorials that can't scale or diving into complex existing codebases that obscure the learning process. This pathtracer provides a structured learn-by-building approach, starting with ultra-minimal single-ray calculations using real OpenPBR mathematics and progressively scaling to full-featured rendering with MaterialX integration and eventual hybrid pathtracing/rasterization capabilities.

The learning approach prioritizes architectural understanding from day one, ensuring that each feature addition maintains production-quality patterns while serving clear educational purposes. By building on Apple Silicon with explicit optimization learning, the project develops platform-specific expertise while maintaining modular design for future cross-platform expansion.
