# Epic 6: Apple Silicon Optimization & Advanced Features

**Expanded Goal:** Implement NEON vectorization, Metal Performance Shaders integration, multi-threading, and advanced rendering techniques to deliver optimized production-quality performance while maintaining the educational foundation established in earlier epics.

## Story 6.1 NEON Vectorization and Apple Silicon Optimization
As a **graphics programming learner**,
I want **Apple Silicon NEON vectorization for ray tracing calculations**,
so that **I can understand platform-specific optimization while maintaining cross-platform design**.

## Story 6.2 Multi-threading and Performance Scaling
As a **graphics programming learner**,
I want **efficient CPU parallelization with work-stealing queues**,
so that **I can understand high-performance rendering architecture and scaling techniques**.

## Story 6.3 Advanced Rendering Features
As a **graphics programming learner**,
I want **advanced pathtracing features including importance sampling and denoising**,
so that **I can implement production-quality rendering techniques and optimization strategies**.
