# Epic List

## Core Educational Journey (Required)

## Epic 1: Foundation & Mathematical Core
Establish project infrastructure, build system, and implement single-ray Lambert BRDF calculation with console output - delivering both foundational architecture and working mathematical demonstration.

## Epic 2: Visual Foundation & Multi-Ray Rendering
Extend from single-ray to full image generation with camera system, multiple primitive support, and basic scene management - delivering visible rendering results.

## Epic 3: Cook-Torrance Microfacet Theory Implementation
Implement Cook-Torrance microfacet BRDF theory to provide physically accurate specular reflection and understand the mathematical foundation of modern material models - delivering core physics understanding necessary for advanced materials.

## Epic 4: OpenPBR Material System üéì **Educational Completion Point**
Implement OpenPBR material model, add advanced lighting techniques, and implement performance monitoring - delivering cutting-edge material accuracy and **complete ray tracing education mastery**.

**Upon completing Epic 4, students have achieved full ray tracing competency and can teach others.**

## Advanced Optional Modules (For Motivated Learners)

## Epic 5: Industry Pipeline Exploration ‚ö†Ô∏è **Optional Advanced**
**Reframed Goal:** Conceptual exploration of MaterialX and USD rather than full implementation complexity. Simplified integration examples and workflow understanding to provide industry exposure without overwhelming educational objectives.

## Epic 6: Apple Silicon Optimization Workshop ‚ö†Ô∏è **Optional Advanced**
**Reframed Goal:** Performance learning laboratory focusing on SIMD vectorization learning with educational performance comparison rather than production optimization. Students understand optimization principles through hands-on measurement.
