# Epic 2 Visual Foundation & Multi-Ray Rendering

**Expanded Goal:** Transform the single-ray mathematical foundation into a complete visual rendering system by implementing multi-ray image generation, camera system, and scene management. This epic delivers the first visible rendered images while maintaining the educational transparency established in Epic 1, enabling visual validation of mathematical concepts and providing the foundation for all future visual features.

## Story 2.1 Image Generation and Pixel Sampling
As a **graphics programming learner**,  
I want **multi-ray rendering that generates complete images from camera-to-pixel coordinate transformation**,  
so that **I can see visual results of the mathematical calculations and understand how individual rays combine into images**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Camera-to-pixel coordinate transformation correctly maps image coordinates to 3D ray directions with educational comments
2. Multi-ray sampling generates one ray per pixel initially, with clear extension points for anti-aliasing
3. Image class manages pixel data with proper color clamping and gamma correction for display
4. PNG image output demonstrates successful rendering of simple sphere scene with visible Lambert shading
5. Console output shows ray count statistics and basic performance timing for educational insight

## Story 2.2 Camera System and Controls
As a **graphics programming learner**,  
I want **interactive camera positioning with field-of-view and look-at controls**,  
so that **I can explore scenes from different perspectives and understand camera mathematics in practice**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Camera class encapsulates position, target, up vector, field-of-view, and image aspect ratio with clear mathematical representation
2. Look-at matrix generation follows standard computer graphics mathematics with educational documentation
3. Field-of-view to focal length conversion demonstrates practical camera optics calculations
4. Command-line parameter support allows easy camera adjustment without recompilation for experimentation
5. Camera ray generation produces correct world-space rays for any camera configuration with validation tests

## Story 2.3 Multi-Primitive Scene Management
As a **graphics programming learner**,  
I want **scenes with multiple spheres and basic spatial organization**,  
so that **I can understand ray-object intersection algorithms and scene traversal patterns**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Scene class manages multiple sphere objects with efficient intersection testing against ray lists
2. Sphere class extends to support position, radius, and material properties with proper encapsulation
3. Ray-scene intersection finds closest hit point across all objects with proper depth testing
4. Scene loading from simple text format demonstrates data-driven scene configuration capability
5. Intersection testing includes educational timing and hit-count statistics for performance understanding

## Story 2.4 Multi-Resolution and Performance Foundation
As a **graphics programming learner**,  
I want **support for different image resolutions with basic performance monitoring**,  
so that **I can understand the relationship between image complexity and rendering performance**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Command-line resolution specification supports common sizes (256x256, 512x512, 1024x1024, 2048x2048)
2. Performance timing tracks ray generation, intersection testing, and shading calculation phases separately
3. Memory usage monitoring shows relationship between image size and memory consumption
4. Progress reporting provides rendering feedback for larger images with educational timing breakdowns
5. Resolution scaling maintains correct aspect ratios and camera field-of-view relationships
