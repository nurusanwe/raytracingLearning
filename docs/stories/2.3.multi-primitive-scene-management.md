    return center.is_finite() && 
           radius > 0.0f && 
           radius < 1000.0f && 
           material_index >= 0;
}

void Sphere::validate_and_clamp_parameters() {
    if (!center.is_finite()) {
        printf("WARNING: Invalid sphere center, setting to origin\n");
        center = Vector3(0, 0, 0);
    }
    
    if (radius <= 0.0f) {
        printf("WARNING: Invalid sphere radius %g, clamping to 0.1\n", radius);
        radius = 0.1f;
    }
    
    if (radius > 1000.0f) {
        printf("WARNING: Very large sphere radius %g, clamping to 1000\n", radius);
        radius = 1000.0f;
    }
}
```
