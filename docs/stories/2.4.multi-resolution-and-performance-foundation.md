# Story 2.4: Multi-Resolution and Performance Foundation

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** graphics programming learner,
**I want** support for different image resolutions with basic performance monitoring,
**so that** I can understand the relationship between image complexity and rendering performance.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Command-line resolution specification supports common sizes (256x256, 512x512, 1024x1024, 2048x2048) with validation and clear error messages for invalid formats or unsupported resolutions
2. Performance timing tracks ray generation, intersection testing, and shading calculation phases separately with measurement accuracy within 1 millisecond and minimum 1000-ray batches for statistical validity
3. Memory usage monitoring shows relationship between image size and memory consumption with automatic warnings when total memory exceeds 100MB and educational explanations of quadratic memory scaling
4. Progress reporting provides rendering feedback for larger images with educational timing breakdowns, estimated completion time (ETA), and progress updates every 5% completion with interrupt capability
5. Resolution scaling maintains correct aspect ratios and camera field-of-view relationships with mathematical validation for non-square resolutions and automated testing for common aspect ratios (1:1, 4:3, 16:9)

- Performance Timing: Phase timers should measure within 1ms accuracy and track minimum 1000-ray batches
- Timing Phase Separation: Ray generation, intersection, and shading phases should be measurably distinct
- Progress Reporting: Progress percentage should accurately reflect rendering completion with 5% granularity
- ETA Calculation: Estimated completion time should be within 20% accuracy after 10% progress
- FOV Maintenance: Camera field-of-view should remain constant when changing resolution with same aspect ratio
- Large Resolution Handling: 2048x2048 should display appropriate memory warnings and performance predictions
- Interrupt Capability: Long renders should be cancellable without data corruption
