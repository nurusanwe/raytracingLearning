### Testing Framework Implementation
**Source:** [docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md#mathematical-correctness-testing]
```cpp
// tests/test_math_correctness.cpp - Primary educational validation
#include "src/core/vector3.hpp"
namespace MathematicalTests {
    bool test_vector3_operations() {
        Vector3 a(1, 2, 3);
        Vector3 b(4, 5, 6);
        float dot_result = a.dot(b);
        float expected_dot = 1*4 + 2*5 + 3*6; // 32
        assert(abs(dot_result - expected_dot) < 1e-6);
        return true;
    }
}
