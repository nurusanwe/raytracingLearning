**Files to be Enhanced:**

- All existing source files (add detailed mathematical documentation)
- Create new: docs/implementation-decisions.md (implementation decision log)

### Mathematical Validation Requirements

**Source:** [docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md#mathematical-correctness-testing]
- Mathematical validation framework using 1e-6 precision tolerance
- All mathematical operations must be validated against analytical solutions
- Edge case testing required for numerical stability
- Energy conservation testing for BRDF implementations

**Specific Mathematical Tests Required:**
1. **Vector3 Operations:**
   - Dot product: a(1,2,3) · b(4,5,6) = 32
   - Cross product: a(1,2,3) × b(4,5,6) = (-3,6,-3)
   - Normalization: |a/||a|| = 1.0
   
2. **Ray-Sphere Intersection:**
   - Known intersection: ray(0,0,0)→(0,0,-1) sphere(0,0,-5,r=1) → t=4.0
   - Discriminant calculation: Δ = b² - 4ac
   - Edge cases: grazing rays, no intersection, behind camera
   
3. **Lambert BRDF Energy Conservation:**
   - Hemisphere integration: ∫ f_r * cos_theta * dω ≤ 1.0
   - BRDF formula: f_r = ρ/π where ρ is albedo
   - Validate with different albedo values: (0.8,0.8,0.8), (0.2,0.7,0.4)

### Documentation Requirements

**Source:** [docs/architecture/components.md#mathematical-foundation-component]
- Every mathematical operation requires educational comments explaining physics
- Geometric interpretations must be included for vector operations
- References to rendering equation theory required in BRDF implementations
- Implementation decisions must be documented with learning rationale

**Documentation Standards:**
- Inline comments for every mathematical formula
- ASCII art geometric diagrams where appropriate
- References to physics textbooks and papers
- Educational explanations of why specific approaches were chosen

**Educational Documentation Examples:**
```cpp
// Example: Vector dot product with educational explanation
float dot(const Vector3& other) const {
    // Dot product: a·b = |a||b|cos(θ)
    // Geometric interpretation: Measures alignment between vectors
    // Range: [-|a||b|, |a||b|], where positive = acute angle
    // Physics application: Lambert's law uses n·l for surface illumination
    return x * other.x + y * other.y + z * other.z;
}

// Example: Ray-sphere intersection with mathematical breakdown
// Quadratic equation: at² + bt + c = 0 where
// a = ray.direction · ray.direction (should be 1 for normalized rays)
// b = 2 * (ray.origin - sphere.center) · ray.direction  
// c = |ray.origin - sphere.center|² - radius²
// Discriminant Δ = b² - 4ac determines intersection count:
//   Δ < 0: no intersection, Δ = 0: tangent, Δ > 0: two intersections
```
