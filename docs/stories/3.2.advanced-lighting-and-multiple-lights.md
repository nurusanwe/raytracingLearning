### Technical Implementation Details

**Polymorphic Light Architecture:**
```cpp
// src/lights/light_base.hpp
enum class LightType {
    Point,
    Directional,
    Area
};

class Light {
public:
    Vector3 color;           // RGB color components [0.0-1.0]
    float intensity;         // Dimensionless intensity multiplier (educational units)
    LightType type;
    
    Light(const Vector3& light_color, float light_intensity, LightType light_type) 
        : color(light_color), intensity(light_intensity), type(light_type) {}
    
    virtual ~Light() = default;
    
    // Core light evaluation interface
    virtual Vector3 illuminate(const Vector3& point, Vector3& light_direction, float& distance) const = 0;
    virtual bool is_occluded(const Vector3& point, const Vector3& light_direction, float distance, const Scene& scene) const = 0;
    virtual Vector3 sample_direction(const Vector3& point, float& pdf) const = 0;
    
    // Educational debugging
    virtual void explain_light_calculation(const Vector3& point) const {}
    virtual std::string get_light_info() const = 0;
};
```

**Point Light Implementation:**
```cpp
class PointLight : public Light {
public:
    Vector3 position;
    
    PointLight(const Vector3& pos, const Vector3& light_color, float light_intensity)
        : Light(light_color, light_intensity, LightType::Point), position(pos) {}
    
    Vector3 illuminate(const Vector3& point, Vector3& light_direction, float& distance) const override {
        Vector3 light_vector = position - point;
        distance = light_vector.length();
        light_direction = light_vector.normalized();
        
        // Inverse square law falloff
        float attenuation = 1.0f / (distance * distance);
        return color * intensity * attenuation;
    }
    
    bool is_occluded(const Vector3& point, const Vector3& light_direction, float distance, const Scene& scene) const override {
        Ray shadow_ray(point + light_direction * 0.001f, light_direction);  // Small epsilon offset
        Scene::Intersection hit = scene.intersect(shadow_ray);
        return hit.hit && hit.t < distance - 0.001f;  // Check if intersection before light
    }
};
```

**Extended Scene File Format for Lights:**
```
# Multi-Light Scene Format with Intensity Control
# Format: light_<type> <parameters> <color_r> <color_g> <color_b> <intensity>

# Point Light: position(x,y,z) color(r,g,b) intensity
light_point 2.0 3.0 -2.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 5.0

# Directional Light: direction(x,y,z) color(r,g,b) intensity  
light_directional -0.5 -1.0 -0.5 1.0 0.9 0.8 2.0

# Area Light: center(x,y,z) normal(x,y,z) width height color(r,g,b) intensity
light_area -1.0 2.0 -3.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 0.5 0.5 0.8 0.8 1.0 3.0

# Educational Comments: Light Intensity Guidelines (Dimensionless Educational Units)
# - All light types: Intensity is a dimensionless multiplier for educational purposes
# - Point lights: Typical range 1.0-10.0 (multiplier applied with inverse square falloff)
# - Directional lights: Typical range 0.5-5.0 (constant multiplier, no falloff)
# - Area lights: Typical range 0.1-2.0 (multiplier applied across light surface area)
# - Color values [0.0-1.0] represent light spectrum (RGB components)
# - Higher intensities create stronger specular highlights and shadows
# - Educational Note: Using dimensionless units focuses learning on lighting concepts
#   rather than complex photometric calculations

# Materials and geometry (existing format)
material_cook_torrance metal 0.8 0.7 0.4 0.1 1.0 0.04
sphere 0.0 0.0 -5.0 1.0 metal
```

**Specific Scene File Updates Planned:**

1. **assets/simple_scene.scene** - Add basic lighting:
```
# Add basic point light for educational visibility
light_point 2.0 2.0 -2.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 3.0
```

2. **assets/showcase_scene.scene** - Multi-light demonstration:
```
# Key light: Main illumination from front-right
light_point 3.0 2.0 -1.0 1.0 0.95 0.8 4.0

# Fill light: Softer illumination from left to reduce shadows
light_point -2.0 1.0 -3.0 0.8 0.9 1.0 2.0

# Rim light: Directional light from behind for edge definition
light_directional 0.3 -0.5 1.0 0.9 0.8 1.0 1.5
```

3. **assets/cook_torrance_showcase.scene** - Material comparison lighting:
```
# Strong directional light to emphasize Cook-Torrance vs Lambert differences
light_directional -0.2 -0.8 -0.3 1.0 1.0 1.0 3.0

# Point light for specular highlight demonstration
light_point 1.0 3.0 -2.0 1.0 0.9 0.7 2.5
```

**Multi-Light Rendering Integration:**
```cpp
// Enhanced rendering loop in main.cpp
Vector3 trace_ray(const Ray& ray, const Scene& scene) {
    Scene::Intersection hit = scene.intersect(ray);
    if (!hit.hit) return scene.background;
    
    Vector3 final_color(0, 0, 0);
    
    // Accumulate contributions from all lights
    for (const auto& light : scene.lights) {
        Vector3 light_direction;
        float light_distance;
        Vector3 light_contribution = light->illuminate(hit.point, light_direction, light_distance);
        
        // Check for shadows
        if (light->is_occluded(hit.point, light_direction, light_distance, scene)) {
            continue;  // Skip this light due to occlusion
        }
        
        // Evaluate BRDF for this light
        Vector3 view_direction = -ray.direction;
        Vector3 brdf_value = hit.material->evaluate_brdf(light_direction, view_direction, hit.normal);
        
        float cos_theta = hit.normal.dot(light_direction);
        final_color += brdf_value * light_contribution * std::max(0.0f, cos_theta);
        
        // Educational output for this light contribution
        if (educational_mode_enabled) {
            light->explain_light_calculation(hit.point);
        }
    }
    
    return final_color;
}
```

### Technical Constraints
- Educational console output for all light types and calculations must be preserved

- Performance monitoring: Integration with existing PerformanceTimer and educational statistics
- Memory management: Safe polymorphic light handling with std::unique_ptr containers
- Cross-platform compatibility: Standard C++ patterns without platform-specific dependencies

### Performance Considerations
**Estimated Performance Impact:**
- **Single Light Baseline**: Current rendering performance (from Story 3.1)
- **Multi-Light Scaling**: Linear increase per additional light source (O(n) where n = light count)
- **Shadow Ray Cost**: Each light adds one shadow ray per intersection (~2x ray count for 2 lights)
- **Recommended Light Limits**: 
  - Educational scenes: 1-3 lights for clarity
  - Demonstration scenes: 3-5 lights maximum for reasonable render times
- **Memory Overhead**: Minimal - polymorphic light containers add ~24-48 bytes per light

**Performance Monitoring Integration:**
- Extends existing PerformanceTimer system [Source: docs/stories/3.1.pure-cook-torrance-brdf-implementation.md]

### Error Handling Requirements

- Light falloff calculations validation for different light types
- Shadow ray accuracy and occlusion testing correctness
- Multi-light energy accumulation validation
