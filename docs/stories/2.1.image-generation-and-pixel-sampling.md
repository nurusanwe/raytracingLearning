### Technical Implementation Details

**Source:** [docs/architecture/data-models.md - Vector3 (Enhanced with Educational Features)]
- Continue using Vector3 for color representation for consistency with mathematical framework
- Maintain educational debugging capabilities with calculation tracking
- Use existing Vector3 validation methods for color value verification

**Camera Coordinate Transformation Mathematics:**
```cpp
// Screen space to world space ray calculation:
// 1. Convert pixel coordinates to normalized device coordinates [-1, +1]
// 2. Apply aspect ratio and field-of-view scaling
// 3. Transform to camera coordinate system
// 4. Generate world-space ray direction

// Mathematical derivation (educational comments):
float ndc_x = (2.0f * pixel_x / image_width) - 1.0f;   // [-1, +1]
float ndc_y = 1.0f - (2.0f * pixel_y / image_height);  // [+1, -1] (flip Y)
float fov_scale = tan(field_of_view_radians * 0.5f);
float camera_x = ndc_x * aspect_ratio * fov_scale;
float camera_y = ndc_y * fov_scale;
```

**PNG Integration Strategy:**
- Use header-only stb_image_write.h library (as specified in dependency management strategy)
- Convert Vector3 RGB to unsigned char format for PNG output
- Apply gamma correction before format conversion
- Educational console output showing image statistics

### Educational Performance Monitoring

**Source:** [docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md - Mathematical Correctness Testing]
- Track ray generation count (should equal width × height)
- Measure rendering phases: ray generation, intersection testing, shading calculation
- Console output for educational insight into performance characteristics
- Memory usage monitoring for different image resolutions

**Performance Monitoring Implementation:**
```cpp
class RenderingStatistics {
public:
    int rays_generated = 0;
    int intersection_tests = 0;
    int shading_calculations = 0;
    
    std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::time_point start_time;

- Image management: src/core/image.hpp (new file)
- Extended main rendering: src/main.cpp (major modifications)
- Enhanced testing: tests/test_math_correctness.cpp (extended validation)

### Technical Constraints
- PNG output capability through stb_image_write.h header-only library
- Educational console output for all mathematical transformations
- C++20/C++23 compatibility maintained
- Gamma correction standard: gamma = 2.2 for sRGB display
- Color clamping: [0.0, 1.0] range before gamma correction and PNG conversion
- Aspect ratio preservation in camera coordinate transformation

## Testing
**Test File Location:** tests/test_math_correctness.cpp  
**Testing Framework:** Custom mathematical validation framework (extended)  
**Testing Standards:** Mathematical correctness validation with 1e-6 precision tolerance  

**Story-Specific Testing Requirements:**
- Camera coordinate transformation validation with known test cases
- Multi-ray generation count verification (rays = width × height)
- Image pixel access and color clamping validation
- PNG output format validation and file integrity testing
- Performance monitoring accuracy verification

**Concrete Test Scenarios:**
- Camera ray generation: center pixel (width/2, height/2) should generate ray toward camera target
- Coordinate transformation: corner pixels should generate rays at proper field-of-view angles
- Color clamping: Vector3(1.5, -0.5, 0.8) → Vector3(1.0, 0.0, 0.8)
- Gamma correction: Linear 0.5 → sRGB 0.735 (approximately)
- Multi-ray count: 256×256 image should generate exactly 65,536 rays
- PNG output: Generated file should be readable by standard image viewers
- Performance timing: Ray generation + intersection + shading should equal total render time
