### Ray-Sphere Intersection Mathematics

**Source:** [docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md#mathematical-correctness-testing]
- Quadratic equation solution: at² + bt + c = 0 where a = d·d, b = 2(oc·d), c = oc·oc - r²
- Discriminant checking: Δ = b² - 4ac (must be ≥ 0 for intersection)
- Root validation: t₁,₂ = (-b ± √Δ) / 2a (choose smallest positive t)
- Educational comments must explain geometric meaning of each term

### Lambert BRDF Implementation Requirements

**Source:** [docs/architecture/data-models.md#material-clean-core-with-parameter-binding-adapter]
- Lambert BRDF formula: f_r = ρ/π where ρ is albedo (base_color)
- Energy conservation: integral over hemisphere must not exceed 1.0
- n·l calculation: cos_theta = max(0, normal.dot(light_direction))
- Final radiance: L_o = (ρ/π) * L_i * cos_theta
